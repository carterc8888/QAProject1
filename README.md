# QAProject1

For this assessment, I created a Maven project incorporating Selenium WebDriver and the TestNG framework to automate and test the Convert module on the website https://www.xe.com/. The project includes:

Automation Scenarios and Test Cases: Developed five detailed automation scenarios and corresponding test cases to ensure the Convert module's functionality.
Automation Script: Created Selenium scripts in Java, structured within the Maven project, and utilizing TestNG for test execution and management.
Load Test: Prepared a load test for the Convert button using JMeter, included within the project repository.
