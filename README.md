# QAProject1

For this assessment, I created a Maven project incorporating Selenium WebDriver and the TestNG framework to automate and test the Convert module on the website https://www.xe.com/. The project includes:

Automation Scenarios and Test Cases: Developed five detailed automation scenarios and corresponding test cases to ensure the Convert module's functionality.
Automation Script: Created six Java files for the automation scripts. One of these files utilizes the TestNG framework to perform all the test cases, which was not explicitly required by the assessment but was included for enhanced testing efficiency. Additionally, I provided five separate Java files for each test case that do not involve using TestNG, in case it should not be used.
Load Test: Prepared a load test for the Convert button using JMeter, included within the project repository.
