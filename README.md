# QAProject1

For this assessment, I created a Maven project incorporating Selenium WebDriver and the TestNG framework to automate and test the Convert module on the website https://www.xe.com/. The project includes:

Automation Scenarios and Test Cases: Developed five detailed automation scenarios and corresponding test cases to ensure the Convert module's functionality.
Automation Script: Created six Java files for the automation scripts. One of these files utilizes the TestNG framework to perform all the test cases, which was not explicitly required by the assessment but was included for enhanced testing efficiency. Additionally, I provided five separate Java files for each test case that do not involve using TestNG, in case it should not be used.
Load Test: Prepared a load test for the Convert button using JMeter, included within the project repository.

| Test Case | Scenario | Preconditions | Test Steps | Expected Results | Actual Results | Pass/Fail |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1   | Validate successful conversion from USD to EUR | website must be accessible and operational | 1\. Ensure the browser navigates to the correct URL of the currency converter website.<br><br>2\. Locate the input field for the amount to be converted and enter a specified amount.<br><br>3\. Locate and click the convert button to initiate the conversion.<br><br>4\. Implement a wait condition to ensure the conversion result is fully loaded and displayed on the page.<br><br>5\. Locate the element displaying the conversion result.<br><br>6\. Retrieve and print the conversion output. | The conversion result is displayed correctly and matches the expected conversion rate | The conversion result was displayed correctly. For example, the output showed "500.00 US Dollars = 458.10911 Euros " (assuming this is the correct conversion rate at the time of testing). | PASS |
| 2   | Validate successful conversion by using the swapping option of currency from EUR to USD | website must be accessible and operational | 1\. Ensure the browser navigates to the correct URL of the currency converter website.<br><br>2\. Locate the input field for the amount to be converted and enter a specified amount.<br><br>3.Locate and click the swapping button (swap the from and to inputs)<br><br>4\. Locate and click the convert button to initiate the conversion.<br><br>5\. Implement a wait condition to ensure the conversion result is fully loaded and displayed on the page.<br><br>6\. Locate the element displaying the conversion result.<br><br>7\. Retrieve and print the conversion output. | The conversion result is displayed correctly, the swap works and matches the expected conversion rate | The conversion result was displayed correctly. For example, the output showed " 500.00 Euros = 545.72153 US Dollars" (assuming this is the correct conversion rate at the time of testing). | PASS |
| 3   | Validate the conversion of a large amount (a trillion) from AUD to MYR | website must be accessible and operational | 1\. Ensure the browser navigates to the correct URL of the currency converter website.<br><br>2\. Locate the input field for the amount to be converted and enter a large amount (1000000000).<br><br>3\. Locate and select the desired source (From) and target (To) currencies from the dropdown menus (AUD and MYR).<br><br>4\. Locate and click the convert button to initiate the conversion.<br><br>5\. Implement a wait condition to ensure the conversion result is fully loaded and displayed on the page.<br><br>6\. Locate the element displaying the conversion result.<br><br>7\. Retrieve and print the conversion output. | The conversion result is displayed correctly, the swap works and matches the expected conversion rate | The conversion result was displayed correctly. For example, the output showed " 1,000,000,000,000.00 Australian Dollars = 3,143,392,136,608.22 Malaysian Ringgits" (assuming this is the correct conversion rate at the time of testing). | PASS |
| 4   | Validate the conversion with decimal values from GBP to AUD | website must be accessible and operational | 1\. Ensure the browser navigates to the correct URL of the currency converter website.<br><br>2\. Locate the input field for the amount to be converted and enter a amount with decimal values (10.754443).<br><br>3\. Locate and select the desired source (From) and target (To) currencies from the dropdown menus (GBP and AUD).<br><br>4\. Locate and click the convert button to initiate the conversion.<br><br>5\. Implement a wait condition to ensure the conversion result is fully loaded and displayed on the page.<br><br>6\. Locate the element displaying the conversion result.<br><br>7\. Retrieve and print the conversion output. | The conversion result is displayed correctly, the swap works and matches the expected conversion rate | The amount field was populated with the specified amount (10.75445), but it was rounded/truncated to 10.75. The conversion result was displayed correctly. For example, the output showed " 10.75 Canadian Dollars= 11.662807 Australian Dollars" (assuming this is the correct conversion rate at the time of testing). | PASS |
| 5   | Validate error handling when an invalid amount (e.g., special characters "@#%^&\*") is entered in the Amount field | website must be accessible and operational | 1\. Ensure the browser navigates to the correct URL of the currency converter website.<br><br>2\. Locate the input field for the amount to be converted and enter an invalid amount (&\*\*^).<br><br>3\. Locate and try to click the convert button to initiate the conversion.<br><br>4\. Check if the conversion happens | The convert button should be either disabled or when clicked, the system should display an error message indicating that the input amount is invalid. | Conversion did not happen, as the convert button is not clickable. | PASS |
